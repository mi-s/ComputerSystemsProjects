# ComputerSystemsProjects
5 projects from my Introduction to Computer Systems class + extra assignments

P1-bitmanip
A project where I solved bit manipulation problems.

P2-bomb
A project where I used the gdb debugger to read and understand x86 assembly code to solve 6 problems.

P3-cache
A project where I created a LRU replacement policy cache from scratch with a customizable amount of sets, lines per set, and
block offset bits.

P4-shell
A project where I created a unix shell from scratch.  It is designed to execute exit, cd, and pwd as built-in commands, and also
exec family commands.  Other functionalities include batch mode and redirection.  Defensive programming was the main priority in the
assignment, and so the shell can handle all possible erroneous inputs gracefully.

P5-malloc
A project where I created an explicit list heap allocator.  It was tested for correctness (passing tests), space utilization, and
throughput.
