Question 1 points and comments: 8/10

-1: forgot to flip using !, please recheck question.
-1: problems with explanation - when describing how numbers are stored,
 'right-most' and 'left-most' byte are not accurate as bytes are not internally
 stored in any left-right order. All that matters is the number of the address.
